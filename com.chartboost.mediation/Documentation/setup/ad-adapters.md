# Ad Network Adapters

## Dependency Resolution & Google External Dependency Manager (EDM)

The Chartboost Mediation Unity SDK does not embed Googleâ€™s EDM plugin.

If you want to integrate ad networks with other supported SDKs as well, you will need [Google's External Dependency Manager](https://developers.google.com/unity/archive#external_dependency_manager_for_unity). For more information see our recommended setup in [Google External Dependency Manager (EDM)](edm.md).

## Adding Dependencies

Starting with Chartboost Mediation 5.X series, Unity adapters are now distributed individually in [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) and [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org)

All available adapters can be found in [Chartboost Mediation Adapters Page](https://adapters.chartboost.com), with corresponding instructions as to how to add them to your project.

## Dependency.xml Files

All `Dependency.xml` files are now embedded in each package `Editor` directory. This means they can't be direclty overwritten. However, this can bypassed as needed by creating a duplicate of such file under your `Assets` directory where modifications can be done as needed.
